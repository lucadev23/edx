            <h3>I studied this languages for what?</h3>
            Assembly was teach me for understand the machine language, so the registers that the machine use AX,BX,CX,DX, and so on... , the functions call and the jump for another function...but it is difficult to understand and it is <strong>dangerous</strong> to use.<br>
            C language was my first favourite program language, it teach me the base of the programming. Thanks to it I understod a lot of things, such as variable(Global and Local), functions(also the recursive), and in generally the vision about programming.
            Java and XML are usefull to develop Android Application.<br>
            PHP,SQL,HTML and CSS are usefull for create Dinamic Web Page, thanks to PHP that is a language Back-end so Server-side, and SQL which is used to send a query to Database for take data by or send data to database.<br>
            Python was useful for arithmetic operations and statistics for the business management subject. With the classmates, I created graphics for represent this numbers. It is very easy to understand. Also i hade took a course on "<strong>edx - Introduction to Python: Fundamentals"</strong> for study other useful functions<br>

            <p>
                <h3>Have you ever studied others subject beside information technology?</h3>
                Yeah! I had studied "systems and networks" and "technologies and designs of business systems". Awesome subjects!<br>
                I'm qualified as an IT technician, so in generally i can design and manage a home and business network, not only develop software for android or windows/linux or web application.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Have you finish your study?</h3>
                No!<strong> I DON'T WANT NEVER EVER FINISH MY STUDY</strong>.<br>
                The IT technologies are always in evolution, so i <strong>can't permit me to take a pause</strong>
                Now I'm enrolling at university, at the faculty of computer engineering and I'm more determined than ever!<br>
                I'm also looking for all the possible experiences I can find, and this is one of it.
